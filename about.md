My name is Michael Drogalis. I'm a Clojure developer and distributed systems designer from Seattle. I'm also the author of:

- [Oynx](https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/onyx): A masterless, cloud scale, fault tolerant, distributed computation system
- [Dire](https://github.com/MichaelDrogalis/dire): Erlang-style supervisor error handling for Clojure

I'm currently a developer with the [LonoCloud](http://www.lonocloud.com/) team at ViaSat, prior to being an independent consultant.
